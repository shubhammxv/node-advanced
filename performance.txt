IMPROVING NODE PERFORMANCE

1. Clustering => Multiple node instances (multiple event loops; one for each)
Multiple node processes => parent cluster manager (monitors health of each individual instances)

APACHE BENCHMARK (on MacOS)
$ ab
$ ac -c 50 -n 500 localhost:3000/fast       => 500 requests on apache benchmark (50 concurrently)

Over allocation of instances (try 6 children and one pool size)

pm2 module => cluster management system
Running server using pm2 (usually in production environments)

$ npm install -g pm2

Inside project dir

// no of instances; 0 means we don't know and om2 sets no of instances to no of logical cores(hyper/multi threading) in device
$ pm2 start index.js -i 0
$ pm2 list
$ pm2 show <showname>
$ pm2 monit

// To stop running instances
$ pm2 delete <name>

2. Worker Threads => Experimental


STEPS
i). Basic express app setup


NOTE
1) nodemon doesn't work nicely with clustering; avoid it in this project
