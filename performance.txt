IMPROVING NODE PERFORMANCE

1. Clustering => Multiple node instances (multiple event loops; one for each)
Multiple node processes => parent cluster manager (monitors health of each individual instances)

APACHE BENCHMARK (on MacOS)
$ ab
$ ac -c 50 -n 500 localhost:3000/fast       => 500 requests on apache benchmark (50 concurrently)

2. Worker Threads => Experimental


STEPS
i). Basic express app setup


NOTE
1) nodemon doesn't work nicely with clustering; avoid it in this project
